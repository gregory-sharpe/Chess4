for the last simulation in the loop it takes 0.03seconds (this uses copy.deepcopy which is supposedly very slow)
to complete the function that calls 200 simulations it takes 5.5 seconds average
copying only took 0.02 percent of a single simulation time cnotrary to my beleif that it was the deep copy that was too ineffiecint
the playout function took 0.97 of the time of a single simulation.
in the playout function:
there was a correlation where when the get_move function took longer than normal the loop took longer as well
policy(state )lookup was fairly consistant at 0.012. almost all of its time was from the logarithmic function
